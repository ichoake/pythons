## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Hybrid takes longer than expected
```
Mitigation:
├─ Use POC as template (don't rewrite)
├─ Scope down to MVP only
├─ Parallelize work with Full
└─ Set 4-week deadline (hard stop)

Fallback: Skip Full, earn $2K-5K/month from Hybrid
```

### Risk 2: Full product gets no traction
```
Mitigation:
├─ Start with real users (Hybrid customers)
├─ Build with feedback loop
├─ Focus on specific use case first
├─ Validate assumptions early

Fallback: Pivot to services business ($2K-5K/month minimum)
```

### Risk 3: Market is too competitive
```
Mitigation:
├─ Focus on unique angle (script consolidation)
├─ Build community first (open-source)
├─ Cheaper to acquire users via organic
└─ Different target than n8n/Zapier

Fallback: Target niche (content creators, data teams, etc.)
```

### Risk 4: You burn out
```
Mitigation:
├─ First month is intense (expected)
├─ Month 2-3 should normalize
├─ Month 4+ hire help
├─ Take 1 week off after launch
└─ Monitor your energy

Fallback: Slow down to 30 hours/week (extend timeline)
```

## 📞 Questions to Answer Now

1. **Can you commit 300-350 hours over 6 months?**
   - This is 50-60 hours/week for first month
   - Then 40-50 hours/week for months 2-6
   - Must be disciplined about time

2. **Are you willing to take customers?**
   - Hybrid: Service revenue requires customer interactions
   - Full: SaaS requires customer support
   - This isn't passive (at first)

3. **Can you handle being bootstrapped?**
   - No funding (at least first 3 months)
   - Cloud costs come out of your pocket ($500-1000/month)
   - Revenue is reinvested

4. **Are you OK with slow growth?**
   - Month 1-3 will be slow
   - Month 4+ accelerates
   - But still organic (no marketing budget initially)

5. **What's your backup plan?**
   - If it doesn't work, keep your day job
   - Hybrid still works (earn money from it)
   - Full can be pivoted or paused

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation

**Both tracks are achievable and complementary.**

**Optimal path:**
1. Build Hybrid (Month 1) - Get working system
2. Earn from it (Month 2) - Validate market
3. Build Full (Month 2-3) - Create product
4. Launch Full (Month 3) - Go public
5. Scale (Month 4-6) - Grow to $20K+/month

**Expected 6-month outcome:**
- $300K-500K annual run rate
- Clear path to profitability
- Market validation
- Attractive to investors (if you want funding)
- Or self-sustaining (if you don't)

**Your timeline: Start this week, launch product Month 3-4**
