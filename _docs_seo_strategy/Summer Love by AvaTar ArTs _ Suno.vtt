00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
We won't come down for later on, watching the world spinning around, bringing you closer like ties to the moon

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
The sun is setting, but we're just beginning, it's feeling spinning, I'm forever winning

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
With you by my side, I know we'll never hide from the love that we found under summer sound

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Summer love, it's more than a season, you're the reason I'm breathing

00:45.000 --> 00:57.000
We're not leaving, we're staying forever like the ties to the moon, we'll be together

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, yeah

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
Now the leaves are falling and the air is cold, but our love is burning, never growing old

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
We made a promise under the August moon that our summer love will never be through, forever summer, forever you and I

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Under the same sky, never saying goodbye

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Summer love, summer love

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Take a walk around the beach, put your feet in the sand, don't you be scared, hold your head

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Nothing can describe a feeling that I'm feeling I'm with you forever more, I'll never forget you

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Baby, you can be my summer love

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
I want to buy what you want to get high, but you get in the car and drive with you

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
Baby, you can be my summer love

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Baby, can you be my summer love

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
In room clouds puffing on loud, we won't come down for later on

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Watching the world spinning around bring you closer like ties to the moon

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
Take a walk around the beach, put your feet in the sand, don't you be scared, hold your head

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Nothing can describe a feeling that I'm feeling I'm with you forever more, I'll never forget you

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Baby, you can be my summer love

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
I want to buy what you want to get high, but you get in the car and drive with you

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
Baby, you can be my summer love

02:47.000 --> 02:56.000
Baby, can you be my summer love

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
I want to buy what you want to get high, but you get in the car
