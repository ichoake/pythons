1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We won't come down for later on, watching the world spinning around, bringing you closer like ties to the moon

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The sun is setting, but we're just beginning, it's feeling spinning, I'm forever winning

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
With you by my side, I know we'll never hide from the love that we found under summer sound

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Summer love, it's more than a season, you're the reason I'm breathing

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're not leaving, we're staying forever like the ties to the moon, we'll be together

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, yeah

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now the leaves are falling and the air is cold, but our love is burning, never growing old

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We made a promise under the August moon that our summer love will never be through, forever summer, forever you and I

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Under the same sky, never saying goodbye

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Summer love, summer love

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Take a walk around the beach, put your feet in the sand, don't you be scared, hold your head

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Nothing can describe a feeling that I'm feeling I'm with you forever more, I'll never forget you

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Baby, you can be my summer love

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to buy what you want to get high, but you get in the car and drive with you

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Baby, you can be my summer love

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Baby, can you be my summer love

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In room clouds puffing on loud, we won't come down for later on

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Watching the world spinning around bring you closer like ties to the moon

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Take a walk around the beach, put your feet in the sand, don't you be scared, hold your head

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Nothing can describe a feeling that I'm feeling I'm with you forever more, I'll never forget you

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Baby, you can be my summer love

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I want to buy what you want to get high, but you get in the car and drive with you

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Baby, you can be my summer love

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Baby, can you be my summer love

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to buy what you want to get high, but you get in the car
