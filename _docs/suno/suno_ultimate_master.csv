In moonlit alleys we used to sing
Now I roam these streets alone
Beneath the stars my heart it stings
Darkened nights I've always known
[Verse 2]
Love was sweet but now it's gone
Echoes of a distant tune
Howling cat took my song
Left me with this heavy gloom
[Chorus]
No more love songs in the night
Only echoes of our fight
Broken dreams they scatter wide
In this alley where I hide
[Verse 3]
I tried to win your heart in vain
Sung my soul beneath the moon
But your love was just a chain
Now I howl a different tune
[Bridge]
No more kisses in the rain
No more songs without the pain
Freedom found in broken chains
Raccoon heartbeats gone insane
[Chorus]
No more love songs in the night
Only echoes of our fight
Broken dreams they scatter wide
In this alley where I hide

In the shadows where the alley cats prowl
Broken dreams and shattered glass
East of town
We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city’s frown
Live fast
Live trash
Beneath the moon’s hostile howl

[Verse 2]
By the fire's orange glow
Our kingdom rises from the scrap
She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
Rusty hearts beating in sync
Wrapped in plastic wrap
We're royalty of refuse
Love in a discarded map

[Chorus]
Love is rubbish
Let's get trashy in the moonlight
Kings and queens of litter
In the city's blight
With dumpsters for a throne
And cans filled with delight
We find love burning bright by the polluted light

[Verse 3]
Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
Stories of old stardust
Told in street lamp wattles
With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle

[Verse 4]
The stray dogs bark a mournful tune
Alley's symphony
Our romance is feral
Wild as the wind
Unchained
Free
No fancy words
Nor clean papers decree
In the trash we thrive
Hearts wild and debris

In the quiet metal seams

And the world begins to fade

Tangled 'round a broken swing
A dandelion blooms where the thorns cling
Scratched up records play the same sad song
We danced in shadows
Where we both belong

Faded vows in spray paint scrawls
In the cluttered streets

Embracing flaws
In a lover's grace

In chipped paint and neon lights
We come alive

Lost in the echoes of a broken past
Your wild laugh

Now I roam these streets alone

Darkened nights I've always known

Howling cat took my song
Left me with this heavy gloom

In this alley where I hide

I tried to win your heart in vain
Sung my soul beneath the moon

Now I howl a different tune

Heroes flexin', villains checkin', messin' with time
Buried treasures, unknown pleasures, minds sharp, divine
In this story, gory-glory runnin' through the lines

Masks shatter, painted faces, breakin' the cycle
Stalk the rooftops, capes torn, pray to survival
Powers clash, burnin' bright, rivals become idols
City burns, empires crumble, war tribal

Deceit in the eyes, double-cross fairy tales
Invisible cloak, silent venom never fails
On a high-wire, crossfire, bodies leave trails

Buried treasures, unknown pleasures, minds sharp, divine

Darkened nights I've always known

Echoes of a distant tune
Howling cat took my song
Left me with this heavy gloom

Only echoes of our fight
Broken dreams they scatter wide
In this alley where I hide

I tried to win your heart in vain
Sung my soul beneath the moon

Now I howl a different tune

No more songs without the pain
Freedom found in broken chains

Unveiling the fight
Against Project 2025's fiction

Truth in their paws
Lies hanging like gallows
Breaking deceit's laws

Against the masquerade

Secrets on the breeze
Future's been tampered
By reckless hands at ease

Once the king of this place called the alley
Sammy ruled with his tune and his rally
But a howling cat came and stole his throne
Now Sammy sings his blues all alone

In the moonlight he strums with sadness
Echoes bounce off the walls of his madness
Every note from his heart always true
In the shadows he fights with the blue

Oh Sammy once the alley king
Now his chords just cry and sting
With every whisper of his string
He dreams of the days he used to sing

On the corner where the streetlight flickers
He remembers when his fame was thicker
But the howling cat's got a brand new show
And now Sammy's sorrow starts to flow

Heartbreak's the beat that he now knows
Defiance burns where his music grows
He won't give up these alleyways
'Cause in his soul the fire stays

Down the alley
Where the shadows grin
Neon flicker
And the dumpster's din
Lost souls gather
They laugh and they sin
Gritty life
Wrapped in the city's thin skin

Broken dreams
Like glass shards in the dirt
Tattered hearts
Hiding pain and the hurt
Streetlight's buzzin'
Like a sketchy old flirt
In the howligritty
We're alert but inert

Singing songs of old desires
Urban night’s a lit-up pyre
In this alley
We conspire

Pavement's wet
Reflecting broken stars
Passin' bottles
And revealin' scars
Love's a thief
Behind rusty old bars
Yet we dance
Pretend we're in noir movies' cars

Alley cats
With the steel in their eyes
Chasin' dreams beneath polluted skies
Hopes run thin
Like the smoke that flies

They drift into the arms of night, where everything feels right.

Shadows on the wall from flickering light
Whispering tales of our last fight
You left your ghost in every room
Loneliness in bloom

[Verse 2]
Promises like brittle leaves
Falling down from broken trees
The scent of you still lingers here
Drowning in my tears

[Chorus]
Love's gone cold just empty space
Caught between heartache's embrace
But from ashes I will rise
Find my own skies

[Verse 3]
Piece by piece I mend my soul
Gather strength to fill my hole
The world outside is calling loud
Stand up from this shroud

[Bridge]
Reflections in a shattered glass
Show me that this too shall pass
A new dawn breaking on the sea
Finally set free

Winding through the wood

Take your fears, a door appears

Moonlit valleys calling
Willow trees sway slow
Heartbreak like a whisper
In the still of night it grows

[Verse 2]
Once was joy in morning
Now the shadows cast so deep
Echoes of the laughter
Fade into the dreams we keep

[Chorus]
Heartbreak hope and memories
Dancing with the trees
Moonlit nights and willow whispers
Take me back please

[Verse 3]
In the night so silent
Loneliness does creep
Yet the moon she guides me
Through the pain in which I weep

[Chorus]
Heartbreak hope and memories
Dancing with the trees
Moonlit nights and willow whispers
Take me back please

[Bridge]
From the sorrow rises
Hope that never dies
Whispering willows listen
To the heartfelt cries

Moonlit valleys calling
Willow trees sway slow
Heartbreak like a whisper
In the still of night it grows

[Verse 2]
Once was joy in morning
Now the shadows cast so deep
Echoes of the laughter
Fade into the dreams we keep

[Chorus]
Heartbreak hope and memories
Dancing with the trees
Moonlit nights and willow whispers
Take me back please

[Verse 3]
In the night so silent
Loneliness does creep
Yet the moon she guides me
Through the pain in which I weep

[Chorus]
Heartbreak hope and memories
Dancing with the trees
Moonlit nights and willow whispers
Take me back please

[Bridge]
From the sorrow rises
Hope that never dies
Whispering willows listen
To the heartfelt cries",v4,https://suno.com/playlist/22665bde-fa4f-4599-afbc-a655a0d78645,"suno-scrape - dataset_suno-ai-scraper_2025-03-08_21-09-00-670.csv, suno-scrape - short-dataset.csv, suno_from_html.csv, suno_merged_master_20250904-143205.csv"

Start this mess in the morning light
Coffee stains on a shirt too tight
Who cares about the latest trend
I ain't no money to spend

[Verse 2]
Rain pours down on rusted cars
Beauty found in all these scars
Turn up the noise feel the sting
Imperfection's the king

[Chorus]
No more love songs no more lies
Only truth under these skies
Chaos dancing in the breeze
Life's a mess ain't it a tease

[Verse 3]
Gravel paths and broken bones
Laughter carved in sticks and stones
Find the gold in the grime
Embrace and take your time

[Verse 4]
Faces crooked stories old
Hearts not polished but so bold
Whisper tales of battles won
In the light of setting sun

Through the struggle comes the light

Broken dreams and shattered glass
East of town
We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city’s frown
Live fast
Live trash
Beneath the moon’s hostile howl

[Verse 2]
By the fire's orange glow
Our kingdom rises from the scrap
She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
Rusty hearts beating in sync
Wrapped in plastic wrap
We're royalty of refuse
Love in a discarded map

Love is rubbish
Let's get trashy in the moonlight
Kings and queens of litter
In the city's blight
With dumpsters for a throne
And cans filled with delight
We find love burning bright by the polluted light

Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
Stories of old stardust
Told in street lamp wattles
With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle

Alley's symphony
Our romance is feral
Wild as the wind

Free

With raccoon band and alley lights
Love ballads soft in the dark
Till one night love left a mark
[Verse 2]
Howling cat took Sammy's throne
Winning contest all alone
Sammy's heart was torn in twos
Music now laced with blues
[Chorus]
Oh Sammy why oh why
Did the alley cat steal your sky
Once you sang of love and light
Now your songs bite in the night
[Verse 3]
Raccoon band plays out of tune
Since that fateful night in June
Howling cat's song took the crowd
Left poor Sammy crying loud
[Verse 4]
Sammy’s tunes have lost their glee
Heartbreak under the willow tree

Ballads now with teeth and claws
Raccoons play with hidden flaws

[Bridge]
Moonlit alleys still remember
Songs of love in soft September
Sammy sings with feral spite
Turning love into a fight",v4,https://suno.com/playlist/22665bde-fa4f-4599-afbc-a655a0d78645,"suno-scrape - dataset_suno-ai-scraper_2025-03-08_21-09-00-670.csv, suno-scrape - short-dataset.csv, suno_merged_master_20250904-143205.csv"

Start this mess in the morning light
Coffee stains on a shirt too tight
Who cares about the latest trend
I ain't no money to spend

[Verse 2]
Rain pours down on rusted cars
Beauty found in all these scars
Turn up the noise feel the sting
Imperfection's the king

[Chorus]
No more love songs no more lies
Only truth under these skies
Chaos dancing in the breeze
Life's a mess ain't it a tease

[Verse 3]
Gravel paths and broken bones
Laughter carved in sticks and stones
Find the gold in the grime
Embrace and take your time

[Verse 4]
Faces crooked stories old
Hearts not polished but so bold
Whisper tales of battles won
In the light of setting sun

[Bridge]
Embrace the flaws hold 'em tight
Through the struggle comes the light
Sing no more those perfect rhymes
Life's in the dust and grime
