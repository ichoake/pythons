I need help with my Python development ecosystem. Here's the complete context:

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

I have a fully consolidated and analyzed Python codebase at `~/Documents/python/`. This is the result of extensive cleanup, analysis, and organization completed on November 1, 2025.

## CURRENT STATE

**Master Directory:** `~/Documents/python/` (ONLY Python location - single source of truth)

**Contents:**
- 3,705 Python files total
- 2,097 are MY user scripts (identified and verified)
- 685 are system/library files
- 923 are uncertain (need review)
- 1,241 folders organized
- Maximum depth: 6 levels (optimized from 10)
- 0% duplicate rate (527 duplicates removed)
- 14 production-ready analysis tools in `scripts/` subdirectory

## WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

### Consolidation (Complete ✅):
1. Merged 12 GitHub repositories into 1 AvaTarArTs Suite
2. Consolidated 9 scattered Python locations into 1 master directory
3. Merged 4 extra directories (Python/, Python-organize/, python3.9/, python_backup/)
4. Removed 527 total duplicate files (7 exact + 520 from extra dirs)
5. Established ~/Documents/python/ as single source of truth

### Analysis (Complete ✅):
1. Ran comprehensive analysis on all 3,705 files
2. Identified 2,097 actual user scripts vs library/system files
3. Categorized 1,241 folders into 13 categories
4. Detected 604 semantic duplicate groups
5. Found 1,276 TODO comments
6. Identified 1,353 files missing docstrings
7. Generated 40+ comprehensive reports
8. Exported everything to CSV files

### Improvements Applied (Complete ✅):
1. Removed 527 duplicate files (0% duplicate rate achieved)
2. Fixed 429 bare except clauses (now 0 issues)
3. Flattened 164 folders (reduced depth from 10 to 6 levels)
4. Renamed 29 files with intelligent naming
5. All changes are reversible (backups created)

## IMPORTANT CONTEXT

### Environment Setup:
- Uses `~/.env.d/` for API keys and environment variables
- GitHub token at `~/.env.d/github.env`
- Has OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic API keys configured
- Shell: zsh on macOS

### GitHub Repository:
- Main suite: https://github.com/ichoake/AvaTarArTs-Suite
- Contains the original 14 tools (now copied to ~/Documents/python/scripts/)
- User: ichoake

### Code Quality Status:
- ✅ 0 bare except clauses (all fixed!)
- ✅ 0% duplicate rate (527 removed)
- ✅ Max 6 levels deep (from 10)
- ⚠️ 1,353 files missing docstrings
- ⚠️ 1,276 TODO comments to review
- ⚠️ 46 files still need renaming (suggestions in CSV)

### User's Python Scripts Focus:
The 2,097 identified user scripts are primarily:
- Instagram automation bots
- Leonardo AI integration tools
- YouTube video processors
- Image/video manipulation tools
- File organization utilities
- Custom analyzers & scrapers
- Web scraping tools

Many files had `yt_` prefix (removed from 29 files, 46 remaining).

## WHAT'S LEFT TO DO (OPTIONAL)

**Low Priority:**
1. Rename remaining 46 files (suggestions in `deep_rename_mapping_*.csv`)
2. Add docstrings to 1,353 files (focus on user scripts first)
3. Review and address 1,276 TODO comments
4. Categorize 923 uncertain files (in `user_scripts_*.csv`)
5. Review 604 semantic duplicate groups for potential consolidation

**These are NOT urgent - the codebase is production-ready as-is.**

## HOW TO HELP ME

I may ask you to:
1. Run analysis tools on specific directories
2. Help improve or refactor specific scripts
3. Review and categorize uncertain files
4. Add documentation/docstrings
5. Further optimize organization
6. Create new analysis tools
7. Review TODO comments
8. Help with semantic duplicate consolidation

**Key Principles:**
- Always work with `~/Documents/python/` (ONLY location)
- Use the tools in `scripts/` subdirectory
- Always dry-run before live changes
- Create backups for all modifications
- Focus on the 2,097 user scripts (not system files)
- Export results to CSV for review

## QUICK COMMANDS

**Run complete analysis:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/python
python3 scripts/run_all_analysis.py --target .
```

**Check for duplicates:**
```bash
python3 scripts/intelligent_dedup.py --target . --batch
```

**Identify user scripts:**
```bash
python3 scripts/identify_user_scripts.py --target .
```

**Export to CSV:**
```bash
python3 scripts/export_to_csv.py --target .
```
