#       FULL COMMENTS BELOW                                                                 #
#      BUT YOU CAN RUN THE SCRIPT RIGHT NOW IN CMD OR TERMINAL OR VSCODE (I RECOMMEND VSCODE)#
#                                 VSCODE IF YOU WANT  https://code.visualstudio.com/download #
# 1. Prerequisites:                                                                         #
#    - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from            #
#      https://www.python.org/downloads/                                                    #
#                                                                                           #
# 2. Download the Script:                                                                   #
#    - Download the script file and save it with a '.py' extension, e.g.,                   #
#      'youtube_viewbot.py'.                                                                #
#                                                                                           #
# 3. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:                                                     #
#    - On Windows, open the Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal.           #
#                                                                                           #
# 4. Navigate to the Script's Directory:                                                    #
#    - Use 'cd' command to navigate to the script's directory, e.g.,                        #
#      'cd Downloads' (replace 'Downloads' with your directory).                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 5. Run the Script:                                                                        #
#    - Enter 'python youtube_viewbot.py' in the terminal. If you have                       #
#      multiple Python versions, use 'python3' instead.                                     #
#                                                                                           #
# 6. Follow the Prompts:                                                                    #
#    - The script will prompt you for inputs like YouTube video URL, views,                 #
#      view durations, etc. Follow the instructions.                                        #
#                                                                                           #
# 7. Read and Understand the Disclaimer:                                                    #
#    - Carefully read the disclaimer at the beginning of the script.                        #
#      Understand the ethical and legal implications of using the script.                   #
#                                                                                           #
# 8. Running the Script:                                                                    #
#    - If your inputs meet the conditions, the script will simulate viewing the             #
#      video using threads and loops, opening browser windows with autoplaying videos.      #
#      Note that this behavior may violate terms of service and guidelines.                 #
#                                                                                           #
# 9. Responsibility and Ethics:                                                             #
#    - Always use scripts responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized use                       #
#      of the script for automating interactions on platforms can have legal                #
#      and ethical consequences.                                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 10. Exiting the Script:                                                                   #
#     - You can exit the script anytime by pressing 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal.             #
#       Close any browser windows opened by the script.                                     #
#                                                                                           #
